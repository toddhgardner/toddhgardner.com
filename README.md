Professional site for [Todd H. Gardner](https://todd.mn/).

## What Is This?

Hello there. This is the source code of my professional website hosted at [https://todd.mn](https://todd.mn/). It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby static site generator. It is built using a [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/) job that compiles all the code down to some plain-old-html files and pushes them back into the `master` branch of this repository. The site is hosted there by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and accelarated by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## How To Run It

You'll need to have Ruby 2.4.5 or above installed on your path. Then run `bundle install`. To run the site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
